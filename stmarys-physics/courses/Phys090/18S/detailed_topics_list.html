Unit 1 Topics (Chapters 1 and 2 of Pasachoff and Filippenko):
<ul>
1. Latitude and longitude (really this was just a warmup for topics 2 and 3), but just to be complete, I am mentioning it.
2. Declination
3. Right Ascension
4. Magnitude ("Apparent Magnitude")
5. Energy and Power 
6. Luminosity
7. Distance Scales
8. Absolute Magnitude
9. Frequency
10. Wave speed, and the relationship between frequency and wavelength
11. Temperature scales
12. Wien's Law
13. Stefan Boltzmann's Law
14. In every one of the preceding topics, we have been building facility with scientific notation and units.
15. In every one of the preceding topics, we have been building facility with proportional reasoning.

Unit 2 Topics  (Chapters 4 and 5 of Pasachoff and Filippenko):
<ul>
1. The Earth's daily rotation (understand the difference between the 24 hour solar day and the actual 23 hour and 56 minute rotation viewpoints)
2. The Earth's daily rotation again (understand the difference between the 365-days-per-year — actually 365.24 — and the 366.24 rotations-per-year viewpoints)
3. The Moon's roughly monthly orbit (understand the difference between the 27.3 day period and the 29.5 day time between new moons)
4. The Moon's roughly monthly rotation (that keeps one face to us)
5. The phases of the Moon (including memorizing the standard names of the phases and what order they appear in)
6. The way the Moon being lit by the Sun results in the various shapes (full, gibbous, crescent)
7. The fact that "from above" (e.g., looking down on the solar system from near Polaris) everything rotates counter-clockwise, and all the things you can deduce from that, such as the approximate rising and setting times of the Moon in various phases
8. The ecliptic plane and the Zodiac (the ecliptic is the path the Sun appears to take through the stars)
9. The tilt of the Moon's orbit relative to the ecliptic plane and how this affects eclipses
10. The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the ecliptic plane and how this creates the seasons and affects the way the Sun hits the Earth
11. The way the time zone system is set up, including GMT and the international date line
12. Prograde and retrograde motion of the planets
13. The Ptolemaic explanation of retrograde motion (epicycles)
14. The modern (Copernican) explanation of retrograde motion
15. Kepler's Laws, beginning with the first Law and the properties of ellipses (semi-major axis, eccentricity, focus, pl. foci)
16. Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times), and how to apply it (I'm not going to just ask you what it is — you must understand what it means)
17. Kepler's Third Law (T**2 = k a**3), and how to apply it, as you did on your worksheet.
18. Free fall (elevator examples and space station examples)
19. Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation (F = G m_1 m_2 / r**2)
20. Proportional reasoning type problems based on 17 and 19
