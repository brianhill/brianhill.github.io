<p>It was great to show the plinth to the half-dozen or so that stayed at the end of class today.</p>
<p>Earsy Crockett and I came back again at "high noon" which was at 1:04pm, and chalked in the angle of the sun &mdash; which was 56.5 degrees as you can see in this picture:</p>

<p>"High noon" is by definition the time of day that the sun is highest in the sky. It is also due south at that time.</p>
<p>The angle we mark at high noon is going to get a little smaller each day until the winter solstice.</p>
<p>Just one week ago (on September 6th at 1:06pm), the angle at high noon was 59 degrees.</p>
<p>I'll send out a reminder before we mark the plinth again on Tuesday, September 20th in case other people want to join us and see what the plinth does.</p>
<p>This year the fall equinox is on Thursday, September 22nd. Maybe we should go out at high noon on the 22nd as well and see what &mdash; if anything &mdash; is special.</p>
