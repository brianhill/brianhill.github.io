          <p>This course is taken by many students to satisfy part of the <a href="http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/undergraduate/the-saint-marys-core-curriculum">Pathways to Knowledge Core Curriculum Requirement</a>. Therefore, particular attention will be paid to the <a href="http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/MSU.pdf">Mathematical and Scientific Understanding</a> goals and outcomes.</p>

          <p>Astronomy is a wonderful subject for the sheer pleasure of perusal, and the variety of things that have been observed lend themselves to catalogs and encyclopedic knowledge.</p>

          <p>However, encyclopedic knowledge is not really the goal of the Science of Astronomy. Instead, the goal is to understand the great variety of observations in terms of the rather few principles of Physics &mdash; pretty much all of which can be written down on a single page!</p>

          <p>Understanding astronomical observations from physics is a two-way street. Some of the principles of physics &mdash; for example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation &mdash; or that neutrinos "oscillate", meaning that they change type as they travel &mdash;  were deduced from astronomical observations in combination with laboratory physics experiments. The relationship is so close that the field is often called "astrophysics" and considered to be a branch of physics.</p>

          <p>To see some of this in action, the associated lab requirement (Physics 91) will be split between afternoon labs where we will do some physics (kinematics, spectroscopy, optics and the Doppler shift), and night-time observations.</p>

          <p>Necessarily, we will include some mathematics. This is integral to the scientific method. Every theory of physics that we are confident of, we are confident of precisely because, they have been tested quantitatively as well as qualitatively.</p>

          <p>The interplay between astronomical observations, physical principles and quantitative predictions  is an excellent example of what the Core Curriculum refers to as the "Mathematical and Scientific Pathway to Knowledge." I intend for you leave the course with a deepened appreciation of that &mdash; while simultaneously having the fun of learning about some exotic and spectacular phenomena.</p>

        <!-- Grading -->
        <div class="docs-section" id="grading">
          <h5 class="docs-header">Exams and Grading</h5>
          <p>25% for the labs, 30% for the assignments (most in-class, some take-home, 1-2 per week), 5% on each unit quiz (4 total = 20%), 10% midterm, 15% final.</p>
          <p>You can miss one lab with no impact on your grade at all. In addition, there will be one opportunity to make up a lab.</p>
          <p>The preceding percentages will be have to be adjusted if the schedule has to be adjusted. (Originally I was planning on 5 quizzes. We only managed to get time for 4. So the percentages have been adjusted to reflect that.)</p>
          <p>All quizzes and exams will be multiple choice. Each lab and most assignments will be graded pass-fail. Late assignments are accepted, but not after the end of a unit.</p>
