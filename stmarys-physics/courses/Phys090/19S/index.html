		<div class="docs-section" id="overview">
			<h5 class="docs-header">Overview</h5>

			<p>Astronomy is a wonderful subject just for the pleasure of perusal, and the variety of exotic phenomena in the sky makes it a life-long interest for many people.</p>

			<p>However, the goal of the discipline of astronomy is to understand the great variety of observations in terms of the rather few principles of physics.</p>

			<p>Understanding astronomical observations from physics turns out to be a two-way street. Some of the principles of physics &mdash; for example, Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation &mdash; or that neutrinos change type as they travel &mdash;  were deduced from astronomical observations in combination with laboratory physics experiments. The relationship is so close that the field is now often called "astrophysics" and it can be considered a specialty of physics, like condensed matter physics or particle physics.</p>

			<p>The associated laboratory course (Physics 91) will have roughly about five Wednesday indoor labs where physics experiments (light, optics, spectroscopy, the Doppler shifts and gravitation) are performed, and about five Wednesday outdoor labs where you will learn to operate and make observations with the College's telescopes. Evening labs begin a little after dark. Whether we are having an indoor or outdoor lab depends unavoidably on the weather. Furthermore, the time gets later (because sunset gets later) as spring progresses. By the time of Monday's 8am class, we will have made a decision whether the weather is good enough to have an outdoor lab on Wednesday evening. You need to keep Wednesday evenings clear for lab whether it is indoors or outdoors. One lab can be missed with no impact on your lab grade. One makeup lab will be provided.</p>
			
			<p>Necessarily, the class will include mathematics. This is integral to the scientific method. Every physics theory that we are confident of, we are confident of precisely because it has been tested quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Theories that are motivated principally by esthetic considerations, or only give qualitative answers, have generally turned out to embarrassingly far off in the weeds. We will review high school math and science subjects such as scientific notation, algebra and trig functions, the periodic table, and others, as we need to use them.</p>
			
			<p>The interplay between astronomical observations, physical principles and quantitative predictions is an excellent example of what the <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/undergraduate/the-saint-marys-core-curriculum/pathways-to-knowledge">Core Curriculum</a> refers to as "Mathematical and Scientific Understanding" &mdash; one of the Core&rsquo;s four pathways to knowledge. This course is designed for you to acquire a new-found or deepened understanding of that pathway while simultaneously having the pleasure of studying the most spectacular phenomena that nature has to offer.</p>

		<!-- Outcomes -->
		
		<div class="docs-section" id="outcomes">
			<h5 class="docs-header">Outcomes</h5>

			<p>The College's summary of what constitutes <a href="../../../shared/resources/MSU.pdf">Mathematical and Scientific Understanding</a> states as its overall learning goal that students "will develop quantitative, observational, and problem-solving abilities." In addition, it states that "students will examine mathematics and science as a creative endeavor," and "they will also consider the social and ethical issues of scientific inquiry and application."</p>
			<p>The course is designed to address those overall learning goals and five more specific outcomes enumerated in the mathematical and scientific pathway to knowledge:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Apply abstract and logical reasoning to identify patterns and solve mathematical problems.</li>
				<li>Communicate mathematical ideas and concepts accurately and clearly using mathematical symbols, language, and formulas.</li>
				<li>Demonstrate an understanding of scientific concepts, principles, and theories that explain the natural and physical world.</li>
				<li>Collect, analyze, and interpret empirical data gathered in a laboratory or field setting.</li>
				<li>Examine social or ethical issues that arise in the process of scientific inquiry or	out of scientific or technological developments.</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- Materials -->
		<div class="docs-section" id="materials">
			<h5 class="docs-header">Materials</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>This is the first year I will have taught the course without requiring a textbook. I will be providing handouts at almost every class.</li>
				<li>In the past, I have used <a href="https://thecosmos4.com">The Cosmos: Astronomy in the New Millenium, 4th edition</a> by Jay M. Pasachoff and Alex Filippenko. It is a beautifully illustrated book, and you can optionally purchase it in the bookstore if you want more details than my handouts will have.</li>
				<li>My handouts will intermingle notes, in-class work, and homework. For studying for the midterms, it will be very helpful to keep a well-organized and 
					complete set of all the handouts. For studying for the final, rely on the midterms. I will re-use many problems from the midterms on the final.</li>
			</ul> 
		</div>
		
		<!-- Schedule -->
		<div class="docs-section" id="schedule">
			<h5 class="docs-header">Schedule</h5>
			<p>For the <a href="../../../shared/resources/Calendar-19S.pdf">Spring Semester</a> we are allotted 14 weeks, not counting the additional week reserved for the <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/office-of-the-registrar/student-resources/final-exam-schedule">Final Exam Schedule</a>. Subtracting one week for Easter break, there remain 13 weeks available to cover the five units:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Unit 1: Light, Matter, Energy, Geometrical Optics, Telescopes.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get the optional textbook, the relevant chapters are 2 and 3</li>
					<li>Note: The Geometrical Optics and Telescopes part of this unit will be covered in the Physics 91 labs over the course of the semester. In class, we will focus on Light, Matter and Energy &mdash; not optics and telescopes.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Unit 2: The Motions of the Earth, the Moon and the Planets &mdash; The scale of the Solar System</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get the optional textbook, the relevant chapters are 4 and 5</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Unit 3: Kepler, Newton &mdash; The Composition and Properties of The Sun and the Planets.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get the optional textbook, the relevant chapters are 6, 7, and 10.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Unit 4: Parallax method, Astronomical Distance Scales (Light-Year and Parsec), Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, Leavitt-Pickering Period-Luminosity Relationship, Magellanic Clouds</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get the optional textbook, the relevant chapters are 11, 12, 14 and 15.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Unit 5: Novae and Supernovae, Other Galaxies, The Big Bang, Dark Matter.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get the optional textbook, the relevant chapters are 13, 16, and 18</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>Five units in 13 weeks means that our pace will be faster than 3 weeks per unit. There will be an exam after each of the first four units, and a final exam that is cumulative and cover the fifth unit. The exam dates are:</p>
      <ul>
				<li>Unit 1 - 8am, Wednesday, February 27</li>
			  <li>Unit 2 - 8am, Wednesday March 20</li>
				<li>Unit 3 - 8am, Wednesday, April 10</li>
			  <li>Unit 4 - 8am, Wednesday, May 8</li>
			  <li>Unit 5 and Cumulative Final - 8am, Monday, May 20</li>
		</ul>

    <!-- Grading -->
    <div class="docs-section" id="grading">
      <h5 class="docs-header">Exams and Grading</h5>
      <p>35% for assignments, 10% on each unit exam (totaling 40%), 25% final.</p>
      <p>Many quiz and exam problems will be multiple choice. To ease my and the teaching assistant's loads, many of the in-class and take-home assignments will simply be graded for effort and completeness. Carefully compare your work with the detailed solutions whenever solutions are discussed in class or handed out, even if you got full credit. You may have gotten full credit just for effort.</p>
			<p>Late in-class and take-home assignments are generally accepted with a valid excuse, but only until the corresponding unit exam! In other words, Unit 1 assignments will not be accepted after the Unit 1 exam is given. Athletes who have given me their schedule of away games have a totally valid excuse that I will do my best to accommodate. Expect that there will be a lot to make up. Rely on your classmates, their notes, and/or the optional textbook. I simply can’t re-deliver lectures to all the people who will inevitably miss one or more of them.
